"""
Simple Timing Comparison Script for USB vs WiFi Communication
Lab 2 - Embedded Systems Course 4100901

This script opens two threads:
1. USB thread: Opens COM port and logs received packets with timestamps
2. WiFi thread: Opens TCP connection and logs received packets with timestamps

Students must analyze the logs and calculate timing differences manually.

Usage:
    python timing_comparison.py

Requirements:
    pip install pyserial
